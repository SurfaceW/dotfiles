# VPN Connections

This is an [Alfred.app][] Workflow to help quickly connect & disconnect
configured VPNs.

## Features

* List VPNs configured under System Preferences -> Network.
* Filter VPN list based on input after "vpn" keyword.
* Connect to the selected VPN if it isn't already connected
  (disconnect if currently connected).

## Installation

This workflow can be [downloaded from Packal][Packal-page] & kept up
to date using the [Packal Updater][Packal-updater].

## Bugs & Feature Requests

Please use [our bug tracker][bug-tracker] to report any bugs, or file
any feature requests.

Please open a ticket, or comment on the relevant existing ticket in
[the bug tracker][bug-tracker] with any of the following to
contribute code changes:
