# Search OS X Terminal commands using Alfred 2

Use this workflow to search OS X Terminal commands by keyword and paste the command into Terminal.

## Usage
Type `cmd [keyword]` (or set your own shortcut) to search available terminal commands. Press `ENTER` to copy the command to the clipboard and paste it in the front-most app (e.g. Terminal).

## Install

Clone this repo and double-click the `alfred-terminal-commands.workflow` file OR download [just the workflow file](http://bit.ly/10Azqx2).

## To do

* Add a "related words" file to expose more keywords than just the command or its description

* Display the `--help` docs for selected command
