"""
Find .sublime-project file on system via a variety of methods.

The primary method is `mdfind`, but this won't return files in hidden
directories.

Use `find` on user's custom search directories, which is very slow.

Also ask `locate`, but it's database may be up to a week old, which
isn't much help (it's also slow). Still, it presents a decent fallback
if the directories in question can't be searched using `find` due to size.
