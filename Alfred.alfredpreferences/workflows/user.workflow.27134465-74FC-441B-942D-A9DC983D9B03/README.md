# Search OmniFocus Alfred Workflow

## What is this?

This is a workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) that performs free text searches on [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) data.

## Why would I want such a thing?

Well, I want it because I can't quickly search for, say, a task within OmniFocus using OmniFocus' search field. OmniFocus restricts search results to the current perspective or selection. [Other people have noticed this too](https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/how-to-search-all-content-a-via-changed-perspective/366).

## How to install

[Download the `.workflow` file from the Releases page](https://github.com/rhydlewis/search-omnifocus/releases/).
